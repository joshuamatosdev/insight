// Catalyst Blocks - Composite UI Components
// Multi-purpose components that combine primitives
//
// NOTE: Card base components (Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter) are exported from layout/
// NOTE: CardTitle, CardDescription are only in blocks/card.tsx - exported here
// NOTE: Table components exported here use Catalyst/Headless UI patterns (TableHeader)
//       Layout/Table uses SAMGov patterns (TableHeaderCell) - both are available
